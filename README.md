## Abstract:
Our project aims to develop an online quiz platform using Java full-stack development to modernize exam processes in schools and colleges. The platform will allow teachers to create and conduct online assessments, saving time on manual correction. It includes user authentication, a database for storing questions and answers, and features like a leaderboard and adaptive learning algorithms. Students can take quizzes at their convenience, and the platform also allows the student to adjust question difficulty based on his/her knowledge on a particular subject, providing a personalized learning experience. We will use HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front end, Java for the backend, and a database for data storage.
